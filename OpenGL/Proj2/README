NOTES
~~~~
There is a 5 shape maximum, it is reccomended to render at least 1 shape
The is a provided default file
All functions (translation, rotation, scaling) are animated
All input is with ARROW KEYS and MENUS, not the command line. (With exception to New File Command)
The drawing is done using glVertex commands
The Menu responds to right mouse button

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the program by compiling via the makefile command.
Run the main program that is produced by that by simply typing "main"
All input is with ARROW KEYS and MENUS, not the command line. (With exception to New File Command)

QUITTING THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To quit the progam and save all data
select the "Exit" option in the pop-up menu
That Saves the data to the selected text file

THE TEXT FILE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OPENING:
By default the program opens "3dcoordinates.txt"
but if a different text file is desired
select the New File option in the menu. Then type the name of the Text file in the command line

FORMAT:
The basic format of the text file is take the number of shapes,
then for each shape take the number of vertices
    then each vertex coordinate (Floats or Ints are OK)
    then for each shape take the number of lines
        then each line (from coordinate "x" to coordinate "y")
	Then the last two lines are the initial coordinates for the rotation vector

This is the default text file, with a walkthrough (// comments are not actually in file)

DISPLAY
~~~~~~
The Bottom Left screen is the XY Plane
The Top Left screen is the XZ Plane
The Top Right screen is the YZ Plane
The Bottom Right screen is used for the menu.
The subwindows are boxed to help display the regions
Each Shape has a slightly different color to help differentiate the shapes
The Rotation Vertex is also visible, with the vertex going from the blue side to the red (Direction matters)
There is one MasterMax and one MasterMin value that serve as the clipping windows for each window.
Vertices are not specifically drawn, just the lines
    (So if there is a vertex that has no lines, it will not draw, but will affect Master values)

POPUP MENU
~~~~~~~~
Right Click the bottom right hand part of the screen to have the menu popup.
The options are to rotate, translate, scale, rotation vector, new file, exit, or print vertices
The submenus pick which shape that function is being applied to

ROTATION
~~~~~~~~
Select Rotate from the menu and which shape to rotate in the submenu
Pressing the UP KEY will rotate the shape is the positive direction (right hand rule) around the rotation vector.
Pressing the DOWN KEY will rotate the shape in the negative direction
The shape rotates only a few degrees at a time, so hold down the button until it is in the desired position
The rotation vector goes from the blue side to the red side
algorithim in Shape.cpp at 44-78

TRANSLATE
~~~~~~~~
Select Translate from the menu and which shape to translate
ALL TRANSLATIONS ARE DONE WITH ARROW KEYS! PAY ATTENTION:
The DOWN KEY moves the shape in the X direction
The RIGHT KEY moves the shape in the Y direction
The UP KEY moves the shape in the Z direction
The LEFT KEY changes the direction the shape moves

PRESS THEN RELEASE THE LEFT KEY BEFORE PRESSING THE OTHER KEYS AGAIN

So for example, holding down the down key will translate the shape in the +x direction
Pressing the left key then holding the down key will translate the shape in the -x direction
Both the right key and the up key will also translate the shape in the -y and -z respectively.
Pressing the left key again resets the directions to +x, +y, +z

IF AT ANY TIME THE LEFT KEY IS PRESSED, THE DIRECTIONS WILL REVERSE
Even if you are currently in the Scale menu, the left key negates directions in translate
algorithm in Shape.cpp at 79-84

SCALE
~~~~
Select the Scale from the menu and the shape to scale
Pressing the UP BUTTON increases the size of the shape
Pressing the DOWN BUTTON decreases the size of the shape
Shapes are scaled about the centroid of the shape
algorithm in Shape.cpp at 87-97

ROTATION VECTOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two options to choose in the menu, and they correspond to the two points of the vector
The first point is the blue side, second point is the red side
SEE TRANSLATION RULES FOR HOW TO MOVE THE ROTATION VECTORS (The rules are the same)
This is the default option when the program starts

NEW FILE
~~~~~~~
Selecting the new file command will prompt the user to input the name of the file containing the coordinates
This is the only time the command line will be used
if this option is taken on accident, enter 3dcoordinates.txt (The default file)
The command will then revert to whatever was last selected (rotate, translate, .e.g)

PRINT VERTICES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to see the vertices for a specific shape, or the rotation vector
select this option then specify the shape to have the values printed in the command line

EXIT
~~~
THIS QUITS THE PROGRAM
Choose this option in the popup window
The program will save all shapes and the rotation vector in the selected file
