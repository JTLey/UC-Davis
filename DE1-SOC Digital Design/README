These files contain the digital design projects from my senior design course EEC 181A/B. We used a DE1-SOC board in collaboration with Quartus, Qsys, and AMP programs. The purpose was to develop functional verilog code that could accelerate processor functionality.

Made in collaboration with Kevin Dinh
